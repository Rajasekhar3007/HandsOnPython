## 🧠 Problem Statement

The objective of this challenge is to build a **Student Performance Analyzer** using basic Python concepts.

The program:
- Takes **N student marks** as input
- Stores the marks in a **list**
- Uses a **for loop** to process each mark
- Classifies students into performance categories
- Counts total **valid students**
- Counts total **failed students**
- Displays a final summary

---

## 🏷️ Classification Rules

| Marks Range | Category      |
|-------------|--------------|
| 90 – 100    | Excellent    |
| 75 – 89     | Very Good    |
| 60 – 74     | Good         |
| 40 – 59     | Average      |
| 0 – 39      | Fail         |
| < 0 or > 100| Invalid      |

## ⚙️ Concepts Used

- ✅ List
- ✅ For Loop
- ✅ Conditional Statements (if-elif-else)
- ✅ String Handling
- ❌ No built-in functions like `max()`, `min()`, `sum()`
- ❌ No dictionary or set
- ❌ No try-except

## ✨ Personalization Logic

To make my program unique, I added a personalization condition based on **name length**.

- The program only runs if the entered name has **more than 8 characters**.
- If the name length is less than or equal to 8, the program stops.

This personalization changes the execution flow and satisfies the mandatory individual logic requirement.

## 📊 Program Features

- Dynamic input for number of students
- Processes marks one by one using loop
- Categorizes each student clearly
- Maintains counters during loop execution
- Displays a clean final summary

## 🎓 Learning Outcome

Through this challenge, I learned:

- How to use lists effectively
- How to process data using loops
- How to implement classification logic
- How to maintain counters within loops
- Importance of structured and readable code
- How personalization logic makes code unique

This challenge strengthened my understanding of core Python fundamentals.
